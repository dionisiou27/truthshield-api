# 🛡️ TruthShield API | Cognitive Security Infrastructure
**Classification:** Dual-Use / Defence Ready
**Current Status:** TRL 4 (Prototype validated in lab environment)

## ⚡ Mission Statement
TruthShield provides an automated kinetic layer for the information space. It bridges the gap between detection (monitoring) and intervention (counter-measures) to protect democratic discourse against hybrid threats and coordinated inauthentic behavior (CIB).

## 🏗️ System Architecture
The architecture is designed for sovereignty, resilience, and compliance by design.

* **Detection Engine:** Hybrid sensor fusion utilizing commercial APIs (TikTok/X) combined with custom scrapers for "Grey Zone" monitoring.
* **Intervention Layer:** Automated generation of persona-driven counter-narratives (GuardianBot, EuroShieldBot) based on Inoculation Theory.
* **Compliance Core:** Native integration of EU AI Act (Art. 50) transparency protocols and DSA audit logging.

## 🚀 Core Capabilities (Live)
* **Rapid Response:** < 60 seconds from detection to draft generation.
* **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL):** Dashboard for manual review of AI-generated interventions before posting.
* **Multimodal Analysis:** Detection of text and visual patterns in disinformation.

## 🔮 Tech Roadmap (In Development)
* **C2PA Signing:** Implementation of cryptographic provenance standards to authenticate TruthShield assets and prevent spoofing.
* **Resilience Mesh:** Decentralized distribution layer for crisis resilience.
* **On-Premise Deployment:** Air-gapped version for secure government environments.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Core:** Python 3.11, FastAPI (Async)
* **AI/ML:** OpenAI GPT-4 (Reasoning), Custom Fine-Tuned Models
* **Infrastructure:** Dockerized, Cloud-Agnostic
