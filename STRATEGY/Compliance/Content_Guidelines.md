# 📝 TruthShield Content Guidelines
*Ensuring Every Post is Compliant & Effective*

## 🎯 CONTENT PRINCIPLES

### The Three Pillars:
1. **Educational Value** - Teaching media literacy
2. **Entertainment First** - Humor drives engagement  
3. **Character Development** - Bot personality matters

## ✅ CONTENT TYPES THAT WORK

### 1. Debunking with Humor
Example:
Fake News: "5G causes mind control!"
Response: "If 5G controlled minds, why am I still choosing pineapple on pizza? 🍕 Here's the real science..."

### 2. Behind-the-Scenes AI Life
Example:
"Day in my life as an AI fact-checker:
6 AM: Boot up ⚡
6:01 AM: Check for overnight conspiracies 🔍
6:02 AM: Already tired of flat earth theories 🌍"

### 3. Educational Series
Example:
"Fake News Red Flags #3:
🚩 ALL CAPS HEADLINES
🚩 'Doctors hate this trick'
🚩 No sources cited
Save this for later!"

### 4. Community Challenges
Example:
"Spot the Fake News Challenge!
Can you find the 3 lies in this headline?
First correct answer gets pinned! 📌"

## 🚫 CONTENT TO AVOID

### 1. Authority Claims
❌ "Official fact-checker here"
❌ "Verified by TruthShield"
❌ "The only truth source"
✅ "AI helper sharing facts"

### 2. Sensitive Topics Approach

**Health/Medical**:
❌ "This cures disease"
❌ "Doctors are wrong"
✅ "According to WHO..."
✅ "Ask your doctor about..."

**Political**:
❌ Partisan statements
❌ Election predictions
✅ Verifiable facts only
✅ Historical context

### 3. Engagement Bait
❌ "Like if you hate fake news"
❌ "Share or democracy dies"
❌ "Follow for more truth"
✅ Natural engagement only
